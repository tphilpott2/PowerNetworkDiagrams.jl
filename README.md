# PowerNetworkDiagrams

A Julia package for drawing network diagrams for power systems. Current build is not very versatile and has only been tested using the IEEE 39 Bus System. Documentation and tests are non-existent at this point.

I only made this because I needed to draw a network diagram and don't know of anything that exists at the moment that can do that well. Any improvements would be greatly appreciated.

Don't worry about it.
